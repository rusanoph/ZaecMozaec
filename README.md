**Zeta-function**
Here is Rieman's Zeta-function series definition:
$$\zeta (s) = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s}$$
This definition is right for s > 1.
In the s = 1 we have Ð° break point.
And for s < 1 we have Rieman's equation, well known as analytic continuation:
$$\zeta(s) = 2^{s}\pi^{s - 1}\sin(\frac{\pi s}{2})\cdot\Gamma(1 - s)\cdot\zeta(1 - s)$$
